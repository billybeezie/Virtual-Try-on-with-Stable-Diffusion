Implement ML algorithms to optimize manufacturing processes, reducing waste and improving efficiency in various industries.

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Step 1: Data Preparation
# This is a placeholder for your actual data loading and preparation steps
# Let's create a mock dataset for demonstration purposes
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
data = {
    'feature1': np.random.rand(100),
    'feature2': np.random.rand(100),
    'feature3': np.random.rand(100),
    'defect': np.random.choice([0, 1], 100)  # 0 = No Defect, 1 = Defect
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Step 2: Feature Selection
# In a real scenario, this step would involve more in-depth analysis
features = df[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
target = df['defect']

# Step 3: Model Training
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Prediction
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 5: Evaluation
print("Accuracy Score:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, predictions))

# Note: In a real-world application, you would also include steps for model tuning and validation.
